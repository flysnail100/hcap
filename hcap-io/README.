# Hcap Library

## Running the Sample
The sample processes the PCAP files linearly. In case you need to process PCAPs this way, refer to `SeparateParsing.java` to show how the PcapParser class may be used without Hadoop.

To run the sample, run 
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.ateneo.nrg.hadoopcap.sample.SeparateParsing"
```
